//! XP and leveling — the gamification core (board #36–41).
//!
//! Pure, side-effect-free model: it turns *learning events* into XP and turns
//! total XP into a level + progress-to-next. It deliberately does NO I/O — award
//! points as the learner works, then persist the running total wherever the
//! progress store lives (that wiring is intentionally out of scope here).
//!
//! The design is adapted (not copied) from the `claude-buddy` companion's XP
//! system: an event→base-XP table plus a smoothly escalating level curve. The
//! events are re-tuned for Tempered's "predict the error, then fix it" pedagogy —
//! predicting the compiler error and passing an exercise are the core wins.
